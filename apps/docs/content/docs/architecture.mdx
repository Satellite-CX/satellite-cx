# Architecture

Satellite CX is built as a modern monorepo with the following structure:

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun for API server, Node.js for tooling
- **API**: Hono web framework with tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Better-auth with session management
- **Build**: Turborepo for monorepo orchestration

## Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
├── api/          # Hono-based API server with tRPC
└── docs/         # Documentation site

packages/
├── db/           # Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
├── trpc/         # tRPC router and context
├── auth/         # Better-auth authentication
├── ui/           # UI components
└── validators/   # Shared validation schemas
```

## Database Design

The database implements a **multi-tenant architecture** with organization-based isolation:

- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces organization data isolation
- All entities are scoped to organizations
- Audit trails track all changes for compliance

## Security

- Session-based authentication
- Row Level Security policies
- API key support for integrations
- Organization-based data isolation
